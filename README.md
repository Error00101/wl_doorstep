An sddm compatible display manager specifically for wayland.

Why are you developing this, there are more than enough display managers aviable!
Yes there are a few out there. But i realy like sddm in combination with KDE. (both apps are incredible in terms of customization)
But i consider sddm broken on wayland (logout? -Nope just a black display. Locking? -No display for you .....)
besides that the last update for the git version (the only one that even does support wayland) has seen its last update over a year ago.

Can I help you?
Yea sure, I'd like to have some help.

I am exited when will it be ready?
To be honest: i dont realy know.
I have an realy huge task in front of me (i have to learn how a display manager works),
and I can mainly work on it while I am free (basically on weekends)
I will give an update when I know more.

Version History:
Version: "A 0.0.1"
First Alpha - basic structure, base idea, a little research on wayland and sddm themes
